# Algorithms and Data Structures Project
This repository is the Python implementation of the algorithms and data structures taught by William Fiset [Github](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsB6SWUrDFW2RmDotAfPbeHu).

# Motivation
This is my small endeavour to learn and understand data structure and algorithm from the scratch. My main motivation to do so is to prepare for the coding interviews. 

# Contributing
If you would like to add or improve any algorithm, you are free to do so. Thanks for contributing!
